323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph
Medium

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4 

Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1

Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.


class Solution {   
public:
    vector<int> visited;
    vector<vector<int>> graphG;
    
    void dfs (int i) {
        visited[i] = 1;
        for (int next : graphG[i]) {
            if (visited[next] == 0)
                dfs(next);
        }
        return;
    }
    
    int countComponents(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // Walk over the graph edges and keep a visited node context,
        // and return count.
        
        visited = vector<int> (n, 0);
        
        vector<vector<int>> graph (n, vector<int>(0,0));
        
        for (auto & edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].emplace_back(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].emplace_back(edge[0]);
        }
        
        graphG = graph;
        
        int count  = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i] == 0) {
                dfs (i);
                count++;
            }
            
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
